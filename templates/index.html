				<h1>Shop Eco-friendly!</h1>
				<p>
					Welcome to our project. Our aim is to provide a tool that allows both consumers, and small business providers,
					to assess the environmental and ethical impact of the items they are buying and selling. Please feel free to 
					explore the site.
					<br>
					Consumers can use the 'consumer form' to check out the rating of products they find out and about. All you need 
					is the cost, weight, material and source, all things you can easily find on the label.
					<br>
					Businesses can sign in to add and view their products.
